Each fwding table will have entries
	with an expiry too.
	after each receiving of call to update the table, decrement the expiry by 1, unless its an update to that entry only.


prepare_table_packet_function
	converts unordered_map to vector_of_bytes
	

do_periodic
	prepare_table_packets
	send table packets
	update the table with the received packets
	also update the table to remove expired entries

send_packet
	create header (if non_table_update_packet then proper ip, else its a broadcast)
	if table_update_packet then broadcast the segment
	else try to forward to the shortest pathed fwding node
		if not found, then broadcast.

receive_packet
	parse_header
	if the header is of table update, then parse that received table and update own table.
	else, if the packet received contains data, check if meant for own, if yes, call receive_segment()
	if not meant for us, then call send to the destination node (call send_packet to do whats it does)
